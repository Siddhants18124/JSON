            <p>The mid-lane star is known for his eight-season long stint at TSM and is considered to be one of the best players in the entire league.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Now, following his return to pro-play in 2022 competing under the Team Liquid banner — and after a year of leading his former team TSM as their head coach — the 26-year-old player has set the record as the LCS‘ all-time kill leader.</p>

            <p>The veteran mid-laner is well respected and considered to be one of the world’s best by LCS fans. Now, he’s made a historic achievement.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Alongside his impressive six LCS titles under his name, he can lay claim to the title as one of the greatest players in the league’s history.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Following the close best-of-five series against 100 Thieves, the Danish mid-laner has set a new kill record. According to stats, Bjergsen is now the all-time LCS kill leader with 2,274 total kills – taking the record from veteran ADC WildTurtle.</p>
